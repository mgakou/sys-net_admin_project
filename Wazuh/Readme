## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In this project, I deployed, configured, and tested **Wazuh** as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform to centralize log collection, detect threats in real time, and improve incident response efficiency.

This lab simulates a small enterprise environment with multiple endpoints monitored through custom detection rules and dashboards for security event analysis.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ My Objectives
- Deploy a **Wazuh server** and connect 2 agents.
- Centralize log collection from Linux and/or Windows hosts.
- Configure **custom detection rules** to meet specific security requirements.
- Test and validate real-time detection of security incidents.
- Reduce incident response time using automation and alerting.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies I Used
- **Wazuh** (Manager, Indexer, Dashboard)
- **Filebeat** (log forwarding)
- **Elasticsearch** / **OpenSearch** (depending on Wazuh version)
- **Kibana** / **Wazuh Dashboard**
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)** for server and agents
- **VirtualBox** / **VMware** for lab virtualization
- Networking tools: `curl`, `ping`, `nmap` (for testing alerts)

## ðŸ—‚ My Lab Architecture
```
[ Attacker Machine ] ---> [ Monitored Endpoint ] ---> [ Wazuh Agent ] ---> [ Wazuh Server (Manager + Dashboard) ]
```
- **Wazuh Server**: Central log collector, rules engine, and dashboard.
- **Wazuh Agent**: Installed on monitored endpoints to send logs/events.
- **Network**: Isolated lab network for safe testing.
